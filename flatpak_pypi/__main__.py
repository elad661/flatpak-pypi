# How does this work:
#
# first, create a virtual environment
# then, use pip in that virtual environment to process the requirements file
# and download all requirements and their dependencies.
# (Use the timestamps on these files to figure out the dependency order,
# because pip will download them in order and that saves us a lot of work)
#
# When we have all dependencies we can calculate the checksums and, extract
# the name and version from the file names - so we can use the pypi API to
# find the URL to put in the flatpak manifest.
#
# Then all we have to do is to modifiy the flatpak manifest to add the deps.
